Brand equity is the part of your company’s value that survives product pivots, algorithm changes, and pricing wars. It lowers CAC, lifts conversion, and makes you resilient.



##### The four drivers of equity

* Fame (mental availability) — are you thought of first?
* Signals: branded search, direct traffic, referrals.
* Trust (credibility & proof) — do you reduce perceived risk?
* Signals: reviews, case studies, compliance, refund rate.
* Preference (distinctive positioning) — are you meaningfully different?
* Signals: win/loss notes, competitor displacement, price elasticity.
* Experience (delivery vs. promise) — do customers get what you promised?
* Signals: NPS/CSAT, activation rate, time-to-value, support resolution.



##### A 90-day equity plan

* Days 1–30: Foundation
* Tighten positioning: who you’re for, what pain, why you.
* Establish 3 distinctive assets (lockups, color, motif).
* Publish 3 proof artifacts: metric case study, expert quote, recognizable logo.



##### Days 31–60: Distribution

Rewrite homepage hero around one job-to-be-done.

Launch a topic cluster: 5 posts around one core problem (internal linking).

Repurpose best case study into a landing page, 2 short videos, 3 social posts.



##### Days 61–90: Experience

Ensure one “aha moment” in <15 minutes of onboarding.

Add education: templates, checklists, 7-minute tour.

Implement review-request loops at day 30 and day 90.



##### Measuring equity without a lab

Branded search volume (Search Console/Trends)

Direct traffic trend (Analytics)

Share of search vs. top competitors

First-touch → closed-won lag

Referral rate and unprompted mentions in discovery calls



##### Costly mistakes

Inconsistent promises between ads, site, and product

Rebrands for novelty, not strategy

Generic messaging that any competitor could claim
