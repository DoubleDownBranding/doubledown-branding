  Brand story vs. tagline? A story is a sequence; a tagline is a label.

  How long? 120–200 words above the fold, deeper sections below.

  Measure success? Hero CTR, demo rate, time on page, reply rate to outbound using the same story.

Your brand story is a tool, not a fairy tale.

It reduces risk in the buyer’s mind and directs them to a next step. Inspiring is great; converting is better.



What a brand story really is

A structured explanation of value:

Who you help (audience & context)

What high-stakes problem they face

What new possibility you unlock

Why you’re credible (proof)

What to do next (clear CTA)



The 6-part story spine

Context — mirror the buyer’s world in one sentence.

Conflict — the costly problem and its stakes.

Insight — your belief that changes the approach.

Solution — outcomes in active verbs, not a feature list.

Proof — 3 receipts: metric, recognizable logo, short quote.

Action — the smallest valuable next step (e.g., 7-min tour).



Where this story should live

Homepage hero → Context + Conflict + Insight in ~30 words

About page → Full spine + founder motivation

Sales deck → Proof-heavy; swap examples per industry

Product tours & emails → One slice of the story per feature

Recruiting → Same story; adjust stakes to talent



Language rules that lift conversions

Write for one person: use “you,” not “customers.”

Cut adjectives; prefer specific nouns + active verbs.

Put numbers early: time saved, errors reduced, revenue lifted.

Mirror the phrases prospects already use on calls and reviews.



45-minute workshop

Interview a customer for 15 minutes: “What was going wrong before us?”

Extract their nouns/verbs.

Draft the 6 parts using only their language.

Read it out loud; if you need to explain a sentence, rewrite it.

Ship one section to the site, iterate weekly.
